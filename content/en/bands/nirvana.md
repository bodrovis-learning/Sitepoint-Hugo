Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987 by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.
